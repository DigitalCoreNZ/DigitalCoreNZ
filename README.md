- 👋 Hi, I’m @DigitalCoreNZ
- 👀 I’m interested in long walks on the beach... Wait, that's the wrong profile. I like code development *and* software programming. Yes, development and programming are different. Developers build methods and functions. Programmers create algorithms and models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue 3 and TensorFlow, two completely different ways of acknowledging my lack of a social life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing, really. See? I told you. I don't even socialise with other code monkeys.
- 📫 How to reach me... Hang on, I’m not getting you down at all, am I? Funny how just when you think life can’t possibly get any worse... it suddenly does. Well, not so much "funny, ha-ha", but more like "funny, this plane *use* to have more wings and fewer gaping holes..."
